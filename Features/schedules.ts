        "description": `When building a cloud app, one of the most common cross cutting concerns is the authentication of users. For some solutions, the security implementation is handled by the application itself. In this session, we explore the use of Azure Active Directory(AAD) to provide the security services for our web or mobile apps.The application we are building is a Node.js backend API with an AngularJS front end.

        We explore the following areas:
        - Create an AngularJS App and use Git to deploy to Azure
        - Add Azure Active Directory(AD) service authentication to protect our app
        - Discuss the limitation using simple AD authentication when enabling anonymous access to some routes
        - Enhance our security by taking direct control of the Azure AD APIs in our code to consume the Jason Web Token(JWT) from the Azure Identity provider`,

        "description": "In this session, attendees can learn to write code that is easy to test, simple to expand, and adaptable to change. At the core of this talk is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which is part of SOLID Programming Principles. The speaker will demonstrate how to refactor legacy code and apply SRP. SOLID Programming is a set of five essential principles which can lead to robust, long - lasting code.Robert C.Martin,software engineer and celebrated author of some of the most essential programming books today, coined the acronym SOLID to represent a collection of what he considered the most essential principles for any programmer.The first component of SOLID is the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP),and in the world of enterprise software engineering,not applying SRP can quickly lead to code with the power of the gods and the inflexibility of a fluorescent light bulb.However, by learning and applying SRP, armed with the power of interfaces and the safety net of unit testing,a programmer can transform almost any code base from untouchable 'legacy code' into living, adaptive code that creates value and can stand the test of time.",

From business cards, to brochures, to kids books and real world games like scavenger hunts and even Pokémon Go. AR is always in your hands. So no matter where you go, your clients have that special touch of interactivity. 

        We’ll be touching on these uses of AR as well as the basics of creating an AR app.We’ll discuss the recent development of AppleARKit for iOS and Google’s ARCore designed for Android devices. And we’ll talk a little about where we think the technology is headed and why we’ll be there to help to shape that future.`,
